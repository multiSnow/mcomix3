Fork from MComix gtk3 branch, switch to python3.

Only tested under Linux.

Required:

- **PyGObject** 3.24 or later, with **GTK+ 3 gir bindings** 3.22 or later.

Recommended:
------------
- **unrar**, **rar** or **libunrar** to extract RAR archives.
- **p7zip** to extract 7Z archives. Note that p7zip might be able to extract RAR archives as well, but this might require additional software (for example, **p7zip-rar** on Debian-like systems), and it might fail to open certain RAR archives, especially newer ones.
- **lha** to extract LHA archives.
- **mupdf** for PDF support.

Run:
----
