    '''Extractor is a threaded class for extracting different archive formats.

    The Extractor can be loaded with paths to archives and a path to a
    destination directory. Once an archive has been set and its contents
    listed, it is possible to filter out the files to be extracted and set the
    order in which they should be extracted.  The extraction can then be
    started in a new thread in which files are extracted one by one, and a
    signal is sent on a condition after each extraction, so that it is possible
    for other threads to wait on specific files to be ready.

    Note: Support for gzip/bzip2 compressed tar archives is limited, see
    set_files() for more info.
